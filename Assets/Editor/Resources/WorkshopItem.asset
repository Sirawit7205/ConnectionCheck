  Title: Connection Check Module
  Description: "Connection Check Module\r\n\r\nMain mechanic of the module is checking
    the existance of line connections from a chart and using that data to disarm the
    module. But you'll have to check the bombs serial number before that. You should
    read the manual to understand what I mean.\r\n\r\nManual is included but you can
    grab it from there as well ==> http://ktane.timwi.de/PDF/Connection%20Check.pdf\r\n\r\nModule
    type is \"graphModule\". I will be happy if want to use this module in your mod/mission
    pack.\r\n\r\nAny comments and suggestions will be appreciated!\r\n\r\n\r\nCheck
    my other KTANE mod too! Cute little creatures. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=777164508"
